# V1

Will be a basic daily reminder for your medicatons, nothing too flashy just yet.

Works only in UTC at the moment!

# V2

Will include other alert types, daily, 2-daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly etc.

Allow to manually setup timezone so we can convert to UTC.

Add dosing info and/or other medication info.

Potentially could be using manual input on how per how many days.

Add medication edit system, so you can edit your meds if there ever is any changes to doseages, or how you take it.
